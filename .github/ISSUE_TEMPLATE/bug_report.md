**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Note that the quality of the generated images are usually not a bug, but limitation of our work.
Also, if you want to use this work as your own font generator, please consider to use other repositories. This work is an academic work, not considering all the factors in real-world.
We will close an issue that just complains about the generated quality.

Also, we released a unified few-shot font generation repository (clovaai/fewshot-font-generation). We recommend to use the unified repository.

We note that now we are not working on this project, therefore any request for further improvement will be closed.
